      There has been increased step-up activity in 2017 with the recent positive market performance.  F10 caps PPB growth at 200% of initial premium.  If there is no longer a possibility of credits - should we allow step-ups?  The only change the client will see from a step-up, is an increased charge (possibly an increase in rate AND charge base).  This will be important for clients that do not take withdrawals and hit their max.  This could also affect policies that are withdrawing.  If the market returns are greater than the withdrawal amount - they may get a step-up.  As policies are approaching the 200% cap - it would be good to verify this is being enforced by the admin. system.

      The table to the right shows the distribution of in the moneyness as of 12/31/2017.  12.7% or policies are out of the money by 10% or less.  The majority of policies have an ITM in the range of 70% to 80%.
